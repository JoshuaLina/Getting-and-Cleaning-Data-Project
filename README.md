# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
##The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
##The dataset is provided by the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset" study, by Reyest Ortiz et al.
##This dataset comprise data from 30 volunteers between 19-48 years of age who performed a six activities when wearing a smartphone (Sansum Galaxy S II) on the wrist
##activity 1: Walking
##activity 2: Walking Upstairs
##activity 3: Wlaking_Dowstairs
##activity 4: Sitting
##activity 5: Standing
##activity 6: Laying
##during this activities the researched captured 3-axial linear aceleration and 3-axial angular velovity at a 50Hz sample frequency
##The target is to provide a tidy data set
##I used Rstudio Version 0.98.1103 â€“ in Windows 7, 64 bits operation System.
##The first step i did was: Unzip the data set in a specific folder called " finalproject"
##Read all data to Rstudio using the read.table function (read.table())
## The data vaiables were
##y_test.txt
##x_test.txt
##x_traint.txt
##y_train.txt
##subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt
##The procedure to obtain the tidy data from this dataset is clearly indicated in the R-scrip

##Thanks
